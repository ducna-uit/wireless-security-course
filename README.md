# Wireless Security Course - Spring 2020

Wireless connectivity to servers and storage is becoming increasingly common these days. To provide security and asurance, wireless networks have adopted many security mechanisms from the wired world. But wireless networks face larger amount of inherent limitations than the wired world. Threats like intercepting and unauthorized access to wireless traffic are real.

### 1. Description  
  
Wireless connectivity to servers and storage is becoming increasingly common these days. To provide security and asurance, wireless networks have adopted many security mechanisms from the wired world. But wireless networks face larger amount of inherent limitations than the wired world. Threats like intercepting and unauthorized access to wireless traffic are real. More mature solutions to the security problems demand the need of understanding the current technologies and the security flaws.

The topics covered in this course are:

 - Introduction to Wireless Networking - Introduction to the wireless world, Introduction to the state-of-the-art wireless devices, Introduction to the current wireless network technologies (Data networks such as 802.11x and Bluetooth), Structured and Ad hoc wireless network topologies.
 - Introduction to Security Issues in wireless networks - Introduction to security principles, Basic encryption methodology, Digital signatures, Program security, Network security, Intrusion detection, Firewalls.
 - Overview of Challenges, Threats and Hacking methodologies - Eavesdropping, Interference and jamming, Unauthorized access, DoS (Denial of Service), Malicious data injection and data modification, Sniffing and stealing, Rouge clients, Attack tools, Covert channels, Roaming threats, Cryptographic threats, Physical threats, Viruses, Target profiling.
 - Wireless Technologies and Security Mechanisms - 802.11i Architecture and security, Security in mobile ad hoc networks, Sensor networks, Bluetooth architecture and security, Virtual private networks.
 - Advanced Topics - Robust localization in sensor networks, Security in wireless mesh networks, Trust issues in MANETs, and QoS-Aware MAC protocols and their security implications, 802.16, 802.20 standards.
 - Countermeasures and Mitigation - Rudimentary countermeasures (SSID, MAC Filters, Static WEP, Periodic monitoring), Intermediate countermeasures (Rogue equipment, Protocol filters, SNMP, Client security, IP services), Authentication and Encryption (Wireless DMZ and VLANs, Authenticated DHCP, Wireless security auditing, Wireless intrusion detection), Other mitigation techniques (Securing the management interface, Wireless locators).
 - Policy and Analysis - Security policy, Vulnerability analysis, Disaster recovery, Scalability, performance, Cost effectiveness.
